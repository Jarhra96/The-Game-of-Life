#John Conway's Game of Life
This project was written in C language.

##How to run:
1. You will need an IDE for C development in order to compile the program into an .exe file.
2. Start the compiled program
3. Press any key and then insert the size of the board you would like as a single number.
* If for example you enter 15, then the board will be created as a 15x15 board.
4. Sit back and watch :)
