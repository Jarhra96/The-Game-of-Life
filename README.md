# John Conway's Game of Life
This project was written in C language.

## What is this game of life?
This game simulates cellular life and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.

It consists of a few simple rules that will determine if a cell lives, dies or multiplies. This
game quickly turns into a board full of living moving cells that appear to be alive.

Checkout this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2vgICfQawE to learn more.

## How to run:
1. You will need an IDE for C development in order to compile the program into an .exe file.
2. Start the compiled program
3. Press any key and then insert the size of the board you would like as a single number.
* If for example you enter 15, then the board will be created as a 15x15 board.
4. Sit back and watch :)

## Notes
* The patterns shown in the video can be made if manually started in such pattern. This program
however, starts at a random pattern so please make sure to run it a few times with a big enough 
grid in order to get the most entertaining output.
